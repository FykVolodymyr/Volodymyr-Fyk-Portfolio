# ðŸ“Š Volodymyr's Data Analytics Portfolio  

This repository serves as a central hub for my data analytics portfolio.  
It contains links and summaries of individual projects where I apply Python, SQL, and Power BI to explore, analyse, and visualise business datasets.  

This portfolio demonstrates how I use **Python, SQL, and Power BI** to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis, Time Series Analytics, and Dashboard Reporting** across multiple business domains.
